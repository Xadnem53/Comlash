# Comlash
Changes the form of the comments  in a source file from // to /* */ or viceversa

It's usual ( at least for me ) to use different comments form in a source file. This small C program, homogenizes the form of the comments.

It dosen't modify the original file. It makes a copy of the file in which the form of the comments has been changed to the selected type deppending on the second parameter ( "a" for /**/ or "s" for // ).
